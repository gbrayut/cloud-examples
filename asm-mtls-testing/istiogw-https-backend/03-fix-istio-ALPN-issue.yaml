# Istio issue https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/40680 is not fixed until version 1.19
# It will cause errors when trying to forward istio-ingressgateway requests to https backend using tls mode SIMPLE
# error 503: upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection termination
#
# Workaround is to use excludeInboundPorts on https backend pod or set PeerAuthentication to DISABLE
#
# https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/security/configuring-mtls
# PeerAuthentication is used to configure what type of mTLS traffic the inbound sidecar will accept
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: caddy-pa
  namespace: caddy    # Can only configure on inbound sidecar side using workload selectors

    # https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/peer_authentication/#PeerAuthentication-MutualTLS-Mode

    # These ports already bypass the inbound proxy, so no use making changes to inbound sidecar proxy
    #9080:

# The above will fix istio-ingressgateway but break other pod-to-pod requests:
# curl: (35) error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number
# You can fix those using a separate destination rules like:
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1

      tls:

    - port:
        number: 19443
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE
        #insecureSkipVerify: true
        sni: "caddy.example.com"
# After upgrading to Istio 1.19, both of these workarounds can be removed and both pod-to-pod and istio-ingressgateway
# should support using tls mode ISTIO_MUTUAL after excludeInboundPorts annotation is removed from backend pods
